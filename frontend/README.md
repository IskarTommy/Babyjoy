# BabyJoy Frontend (placeholder)

This folder will contain the Lovable-generated React + TypeScript frontend for BabyJoy.

Next steps for you:

1. Copy the Lovable project files into this `frontend/` directory. Include at minimum:
   - `package.json`
   - `src/`, `public/` (or equivalent)
   - any build scripts

2. After the files are in place, tell me and I will:
   - run `npm install` in `frontend/` to install dependencies
   - run `npm run dev` (or the appropriate dev script) and configure a proxy to your Django API if needed
   - make any small edits required to adapt paths or environment variables

Commands I will run once you confirm the files are copied (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd c:\Babyjoy\frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

If your Lovable project expects environment variables, create a `.env.local` here (do not commit it):

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
# other VITE_ variables as needed
```

If you want me to scaffold a fresh Vite + React + TypeScript app instead, say so and I will create it here and add a small sample page that calls the Django API.
